  <h2><strong>Step 1: Understanding Your Event Goals and Objectives</strong></h2>
<p>The foundation of any successful event begins with understanding why the event is being held.</p>
<h3>What event managers focus on:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Purpose of the event (brand awareness, employee engagement, lead generation)</p>
